                    Bousiquot has been developing for the web and mobile platforms for a couple of years now. He uses awesome technologies to build awesome web & mobile applications for his clients, ranging from individuals to small businesses in the area. A fanatic of new technologies, he tries his best not to fall to the trap of spending too much time learning a new tool or framework that might be useless for his personal or clients' projects. He also runs a <a href="{{ $blogUrl }}" target="blank">blog</a> on new technologies, libraries, frameworks and other tools he uses on a daily basis.

                    When he's not behind a computer screen you can find him surfing the internet from his phone or playing video games or something like that. Yeah but especially not in that order.

                    He also loves to read, but mainly techninal books and articles; speaks and writes in 4 languages: Creole, French, English and Spanish (actually the latter, not very well.)
